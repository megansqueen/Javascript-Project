Have you always wanted to know which cat you were from aristocats? Are you a pretty princess like Marie, or are you wise and stable like Duchess - find out by visiting my Aristocatapp and taking a brief quiz!

This app is purely intended to add a little fun while also providing an education about the worlds best pet - Cats!

When you launch this application you will see that the CSS style presents a bright pink background with Disney traditional font. The quiz begins once the user hits the "start" botton like so:

As you continue through the quiz, you will have messages indicating whether you answered correctly or incorrectly. If answered incorrectly, you will see that the question button container turns red. On the other hand, answer correctly and the question container will be green!

by the end of the quiz, you will be rewarded with a direct comparison to one of our beloved Disney Aristocat characters depending on how well you performed.

Highest scores with the most kitty knowledge are up there with Duchess.
